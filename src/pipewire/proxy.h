/** \page page_proxy Proxy
 *
 * \section sec_page_proxy_overview Overview
 *
 * The proxy object is a client side representation of a resource
 * that lives on a remote PipeWire instance.
 *
 * It is used to communicate with the remote object.
 *
 * \section sec_page_proxy_core Core proxy
 *
 * A proxy for a remote core object can be obtained by making
 * a remote connection. See \ref pw_page_remote_api
 *
 * A pw_core_proxy can then be retrieved with \ref pw_remote_get_core_proxy
 *
 * Some methods on proxy object allow creation of more proxy objects or
 * create a binding between a local proxy and global resource.
 *
 * \section sec_page_proxy_create Create
 *
 * A client first creates a new proxy object with pw_proxy_new(). A
 * type must be provided for this object.
 *
 * The protocol of the context will usually install an interface to
 * translate method calls and events to the wire format.
 *
 * The creator of the proxy will usually also install an event
 * implementation of the particular object type.
 *
 * \section sec_page_proxy_bind Bind
 *
 * To actually use the proxy object, one needs to create a server
 * side resource for it. This can be done by, for example, binding
 * to a global object or by calling a method that creates and binds
 * to a new remote object. In all cases, the local id is passed to
 * the server and is used to create a resource with the same id.
 *
 * \section sec_page_proxy_methods Methods
 *
 * To call a method on the proxy use the interface methods. Calling
 * any interface method will result in a request to the server to
 * perform the requested action on the corresponding resource.
 *
 * \section sec_page_proxy_events Events
 *
 * Events send from the server to the proxy will be demarshalled by
 * the protocol and will then result in a call to the installed
 * implementation of the proxy.
 *
 * \section sec_page_proxy_destroy Destroy
 *
 * Use pw_proxy_destroy() to destroy the client side object. This
 * is usually done automatically when the server removes the resource
 * associated to the proxy.

/** \class pw_proxy
 *
 * \brief Represents an object on the client side.
 *
 * A pw_proxy acts as a client side proxy to an object existing in a remote
 * pipewire instance. The proxy is responsible for converting interface functions
 * invoked by the client to PipeWire messages. Events will call the handlers
 * set in listener.
 *
 * See \ref page_proxy
